# Unity Flappy Pappy

## Description

Flappy Pappy is a Flappy Bird clone built in Unity using C#. It was made following a tutorial in order to learn to use Unity.

While building this project I learned to:

- Build a scene using Unity
- Track the state of `GameObjects` and dynamically change them based on C# logic
- Use collision to cause various effects such as stopping movement, increasing score, and ending the game
